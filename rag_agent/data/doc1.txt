Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish themselves over time, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. 
Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources emit little to no greenhouse gases, making them essential for combating climate change. 
Solar power uses photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems to convert sunlight into electricity or heat. 
Wind energy harnesses kinetic energy from moving air using wind turbines. 
Hydropower captures energy from flowing water, while geothermal energy uses the Earth's internal heat. 
Biomass energy converts organic materials such as plants, crop residues, and waste into fuels and electricity. 
The main benefits of renewable energy include sustainability, energy independence, reduced pollution, and job creation in the clean-energy sector.
Challenges include intermittency, high initial costs, and the need for storage and grid integration.
