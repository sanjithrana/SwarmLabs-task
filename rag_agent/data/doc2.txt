Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
Core AI domains include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems. 
Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and deep learning allow systems to identify patterns and make predictions from data. 
Natural language processing enables computers to understand and generate human language, powering chatbots, translation systems, and virtual assistants. 
AI is transforming industries including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and manufacturing. 
Ethical challenges include data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and job displacement.
